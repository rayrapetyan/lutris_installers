description: This game requires an SSD hard drive as 3D models are lazy loaded constantly.
notes: "For AMD users: It's recommended to use a virtual desktop as GW2's launcher\
  \ will slow most desktop environments to a crawl only recoverable by hard reboot.\
  \ Running GW2's exe with -image lets it download all game data and updates. For\
  \ convenience, It's recommended to create a context menu entry for updating the\
  \ game.\r\n\r\nTo improve perfomance, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/fhEr0rW.jpg\"\
  >these settings</a>. are suggested. Also, using a fast SSD hard drive can massively\
  \ reduce, or eliminate stuttering on this game."
