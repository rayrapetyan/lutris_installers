notes: "Open the Lutris version of Retroarch by selecting one of your libretro games\
  \ and make sure you have your controller configured. A .bin file for the game must\
  \ be in the same folder as the .cue file chosen.\r\nMake sure your libretro runner\
  \ points to the correct retroarch config file by default."
