description: ''
notes: "- Recent GOG installer required (v2 or above).\r\n- Uses the Commandos 2+3\
  \ GOG installer but only installs Commandos 2.\r\n- Fix for multiplayer by TCP/IP\
  \ included.\r\n- Movies won't play. You can play them manually from the DATA/WOFIP\
  \ folder...\r\n- The game may leave fullscreen sometimes, hit Alt+Enter a couple\
  \ times when it happens.\r\n- The mouse may not be captured well initially, just\
  \ move it around until the cursor appears and avoid clicking until then."
