description: Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is a first-person action video game with
  role-playing elements developed by Arkane Studios. The player controls Sareth, the
  apprentice of the wizard Phenrig, after he is sent to the city of Stonehelm to accompany
  an expedition trying to retrieve a powerful artifact known as "The Skull of Shadows".
notes: "Game quits after video settings change, and keyboard may need to be mapped\
  \ on non-standard configurations.\r\n\r\nOther than that, everything works great!"
