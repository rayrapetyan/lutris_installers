description: The Steam Proton version of the game mostly works. See the Technical
  notes for common troubleshooting.
notes: "If your audio does not work, go to you Steam library -> Fallout 4 -> Preferences\
  \ -> Set Launch Command and put 'WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"xaudio2_7=n,b\" %command%' there.\r\
  \n\r\nIf you want to fix the annoying issues with Xserver multi-monitor mouse, set\
  \ your other monitor (the one you do NOT want to play on) as primary and configure\
  \ the game window to run at an offset (on the monitor you want to play on). Let's\
  \ say we have two monitors - the one on the left @1920x1080 set as Primary and the\
  \ other (on the right, the one you actually want your game to display on) @2560x1080.\
  \ Put something like this into your Fallout4.ini:\r\n\r\niLocation X=1920\r\niLocation\
  \ Y=0\r\niPresentInterval=0\r\nbBorderless=1\r\nbFull Screen=0\r\nbMaximizeWindow=1\r\
  \niSize H=1080\r\niSize W=2560\r\n\r\n This piece of config will offset the game\
  \ window by 1920 pixels to the right, set it to 2560x1080 borderless, disable fullscreen\
  \ and disable in-game v-sync. Going into the Options from the game launcher will\
  \ screw these up so make sure you set your graphics options before you do these\
  \ tweaks."
