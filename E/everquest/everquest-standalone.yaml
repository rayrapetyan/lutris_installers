notes: "During the installation of Everquest itself, it will need to install DirectX\
  \ updates.  In this phase, take note that there is a Bing toolbar it wants to install.\
  \  This is most certainly NOT needed, and you may uncheck this box to not install\
  \ it.\r\n\r\nOnce you start the game, if you have a cursor that is off from where\
  \ it clicks, just maximize the window and it will fix itself."
