description: Sonic Robo Blast 2 is a 3D open-source Sonic the Hedgehog fangame built
  using a modified version of the Doom Legacy port of Doom. SRB2 is closely inspired
  by the original Sonic games from the Sega Genesis, and attempts to recreate the
  design in 3D. While SRB2 isn't fully completed, it already features tons of levels,
  enemies, speed, and quite a lot of the fun that the original Sonic games provided.
