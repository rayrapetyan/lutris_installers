description: DXVK and esync ready.
notes: "Currently, installing games on the launcher, quitting it, running Fallout\
  \ 76 on Nvidia and mouse acceleration are 4 well known issue.\r\n\r\nFor everyone:\r\
  \nThere will be a little script placed in the launcher folder so it'll be easier\
  \ to install and update the game. It's currently located in Bethesda launcher folder\
  \ (by default, game_directory/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Bethesda.Net Launcher/helper.sh).\
  \ Run it in its current folder (and the working directory must be Bethesda.Net launcher's\
  \ directory) when first installing or when updating the game.\r\n\r\nIf you want\
  \ to copy paste an already existing FO76 installation, just start the installation,\
  \ close the launcher, paste your game files where you choose to install FO76 with\
  \ the launcher, then launch the launcher again. You may need to still run the helper.sh\
  \ script.\r\n\r\nYou'll also need to disable the mouse acceleration. There will\
  \ be a Fallout76Custom.ini in the root of the game directory (there will be another\
  \ one for Nvidia users, I'll talk about that one later), copy-paste it in ~/Documents/Fallout\
  \ 76 when you have launched FO76 a first time.\r\n\r\nFinally, the launcher won't\
  \ close softly by itself, just close it via the corresponding button in Lutris and\
  \ you should be fine.\r\n\r\nFor Nvidia users:\r\nThere will be a custom pref file\
  \ directly at the root of the game directory (where you installed the whole thing),\
  \ it's called Fallout76CustomNvidia.ini. If you've read about, you should already\
  \ have pasted an ini for the mouse issue. Just rename that one Fallout76Custom.ini\
  \ and replace the other one.\r\n\r\nAltough, the whole experience may or may not\
  \ work perfectly. You may need to create your character on a Windows installation\
  \ because of a known crash, and you may randomly crash depending on your available\
  \ RAM of sort (not 100% sure why it happens, and not even sure if it has anything\
  \ to do with RAM, but yeah, sometimes, I had VkAlloc errors and Wine access violation\
  \ after either a couple of minute or a dozen of hours, it really depends).\r\n\r\
  \nPlay at your own risks, it's still an online game being played on Wine, although\
  \ currently no report of ban has been seen. And in general, it's pretty... Alpha-ish,\
  \ when it comes to crashes and Nvidia driver, hope you'll have luck !"
