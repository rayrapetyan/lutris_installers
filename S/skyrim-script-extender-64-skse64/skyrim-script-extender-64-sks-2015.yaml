description: "For a copy of Skyrim Special Edition installed for Steam Play only.\
  \ Lauching SKSE64 from within Lutris will run the default game launcher. In order\
  \ to play the game using SKSE64 the game must be run from Steam (or Lutris, which\
  \ launches Steam).\r\n\r\nA few manual steps are required, the installer will guide\
  \ you trough them.\r\n\r\nRemember to check the know bugs and limitations in lutris.net\
  \ before using this installer"
notes: "KNOW BUGS/LIMITATIONS:\r\n-Launching SKSE64 from within Lutris allows the\
  \ user to launch Skyrim's default launcher but starting the game from within this\
  \ launcher will not load SKSE. This is the default SKSE behavior;\r\n-Manual steps\
  \ are required in order for SKSE to run using Skyrim's custom proton prefix, which\
  \ can only be done from within Steam. The installer will inform the needed steps;\r\
  \n-After installation is complete Steam may run first time setup again, which will\
  \ cause fAudio to be overridden and game settings to be erased;"
