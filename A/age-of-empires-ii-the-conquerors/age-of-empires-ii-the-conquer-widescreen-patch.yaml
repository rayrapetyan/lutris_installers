description: Patch to play in widescreen format.
notes: A resolution higher than 1280x1024 is necessary for the patch to work. This
  patch simply replaces the numbers 1280 and 1024 in the game binary by the current
  resolution. Therefore you must set the resolution to 1280x1024 in the game options.
