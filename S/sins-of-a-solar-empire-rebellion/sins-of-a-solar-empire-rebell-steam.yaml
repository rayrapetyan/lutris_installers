notes: "!ATTENTION! After installation:\r\n1) Set option: \"Do not launch game, only\
  \ open Steam\"\r\n2) Run the prefix\r\n3) Right click your prefix and select \"\
  Run EXE inside prefix\"\r\n4) Select \"Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion.exe\"\r\n\
  \r\nCurrently I'm searching a way to bypass the StardockLauncher\r\nYou can fiddle\
  \ around with the Steam Launch Option: \"/nolauncher\" did not worked for me yet.\r\
  \n\r\nIf any First Time Setups fail on your system configuration you can skip them\
  \ by killing the install task. All dependencies are installed by this installer."
