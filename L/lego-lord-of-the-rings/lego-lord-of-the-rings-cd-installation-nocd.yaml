version: CD Installation + NoCDfix
description: This installer is for the DVD released 2012. The CD is only needed for
  installation. A NoCDfix will be downloaded so the game can be played without the
  cd in the drive. This installer should make it easy to use every gamepad to play
  together or alone.
notes: "If you're installer seems to be crashed don't close it, it just doesn't respond\
  \ when its copying files.\r\nDepending on your gamepad you have to either deactivate\
  \ the *(event) or *(js) device in the joystick control panel.(You have to try which)"
