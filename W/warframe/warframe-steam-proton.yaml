description: Default Steam Installation with Proton
notes: "The proton version requires xboxdrv to be running as a service as a \"fake\"\
  \ controller, otherwise the game will close after 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nIf you get DirectX\
  \ errors, it means you're missing vulkan libraries. You need both 32 bit and 64\
  \ bit vulkan libraries installed on your system for your distro. The reason is because\
  \ the game is 64 bit but the launcher is 32 bit so the launcher checks for 32 bit.\r\
  \n\r\nIn order to fix voices and other game issues, you'll want to use GE's proton.\
  \ Instructions can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases"
