notes: The libGL from 2013 is required to run the game. libgl1-mesa-glx_13.0.2-3+bsos1_amd64;
  this used to be located <a href="http://repo.steampowered.com/steamos/pool/main/m/mesa/">here</a>  as
  a whole package. Unfortunately it is no more (updated to a newer version), I uploaded
  the raw file you need to place into the root of your game folder <a href="https://github.com/Farcrada/DyingLight_LibGl1_getter">here</a>.
