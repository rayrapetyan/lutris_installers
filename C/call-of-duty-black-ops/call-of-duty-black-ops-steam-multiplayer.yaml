version: Steam (Multiplayer)
description: This version installs the multiplayer, which is needed for some dependencies
  in certain maps.
notes: Current iteration requires manually editing "config_mp.cfg" in the game's `players`
  folder if a blur effect envelopes the screen on ADS. Look for a line labeled `seta
  r_dof_enable`. Set the value to `"0"`.
