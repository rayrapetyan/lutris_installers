description: "Installer which requires 2 CDs for the game installation.\r\nThis installer\
  \ will copy the content of the entire 1st disc into the wine prefix in order to\
  \ launch the setup from there and prevent Linux from refusing to eject the CD ROM\
  \ because of open files. You'll be able to switch CDs if requested by the installer."
