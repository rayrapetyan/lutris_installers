description: "The file that is required for installation is named \"Portal-StillAlive_Release.7z\"\
  \ and can be downloaded here;\r\nhttps://www.moddb.com/mods/portal-still-alive-pc/downloads"
notes: 'I found (possibly as a result of this bug: https://github.com/lutris/lutris/issues/1999)
  that on the first run the installer will request to install Portal, even though
  it is already installed.  Agreeing to install Portal results in a second entry for
  Portal in the library and the installer quitting without finishing the installation
  of the mod (which may be another bug).  A second run of the installer will succeed,
  as Lutris now believes that Portal is installed and continues without that step.'
