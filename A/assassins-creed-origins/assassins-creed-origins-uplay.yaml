description: This should install UPlay to allow you to download Assassin's Creed Origins
  and play. The game runs flawlessly at a stable 60fps.
notes: "For it to work I had to disable  System options / Prefer System libraries.\r\
  \n\r\nThe only issue that I noticed is with the stone circles mission the sky view\
  \ makes the game crash or run very slowly."
