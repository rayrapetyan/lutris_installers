description: Uses a 3rd party build of Wine shipped in an AppImage container. This
  build of Wine has not been audited for security purposes and is not hosted on our
  servers.
notes: "If you have issues with edge scrolling, try setting League to borderless mode\
  \ instead of fullscreen.\r\n\r\nThis build is unstable on Arch and broken on Manjaro.\
  \ If you are on an Arch-based distribution, it is suggested to use the following\
  \ guide instead: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflinux/comments/bx0y2s/success_latest_arch_linux_winelol_patch_911/"
