description: Downloads newest client from Autodesk and patches the installer for installation.
notes: "Manual Tasks:\r\n- Sometimes the script doesn't want to wait for the download\
  \ to finish, please check your $CACHE (default: ~/.cache/lutris/installer/autodesk_fusion_360/)\
  \ and/or check your internet connection if something is still downloading, then\
  \ proceed\r\n- After you have signed in you need to change the Graphics driver in\
  \ your preferences to DirectX 9, apply and choose 'Not Now' and close Fusion manually\
  \ (you might need to kill the wine processes since Fusion is pretty weird in the\
  \ pre-selected graphic state)\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- The GUI's floating tooltip/toolsettings\
  \ windows seem to float above anything, resize them once for a small amount to stop\
  \ them from staying on top of everything, some menues also need to be clicked once\
  \ too"
