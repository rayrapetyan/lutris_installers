description: GOG installer with DXVK.  Installs DX-2010 and Visual C++ 2015 as dependencies
  (same as Steam) within the wine prefix.
notes: The installer will complain 3 times with various indices out of range errors
  at around 95% complete.  Click OK through each of these and it will install fine.
