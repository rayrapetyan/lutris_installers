notes: "Found an odd alt-tab bug where you can not get back into the game after doing\
  \ so. I have not encountered this bug on older wine versions, i.e. 1.9.8-x86_64.\
  \ \r\n\r\nMultiplayer:\r\nQuoted from the WineHQ Page for the steam version of this\
  \ game found here: https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=33630\r\
  \n\r\n\"HOWTO\r\nMultiplayer\r\n\r\nTo get multiplayer working, place the DLLs in\
  \ this archive in Wine's windows/system32 directory. Then, start winecfg and add\
  \ dll overrides (native, builtin) for the following DLLs: dplayx, dpnet, dpnhpast\
  \ and dpwsockx.\r\nNOTE: The host should leave the game last, otherwise it will\
  \ hang for the other players when they try to leave.\""
