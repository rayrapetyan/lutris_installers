description: RIFT is a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).
  RIFT is very similar to World of Warcraft but requires no subscription.
notes: "Make sure you have cabextract, wine-staging and winetricks installed before\
  \ installing RIFT. For installation information consult your distribution's documentation.\r\
  \n\r\nFor RIFT in game graphical glitches change the executable to 32bit in the\
  \ Glyph launcher's settings and enable CMST in WINE-Staging's winecfg (under the\
  \ staging tab)."
