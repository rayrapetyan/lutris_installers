notes: "Moves all the requierd install files to a folder then runs the setup.\r\n\
  After the installer crashes, you'll have to end the process \"cod2.exe\" using a\
  \ task manager, or else the process will not proceed.\r\nYou might need a no-cd\
  \ crack as well due to the use of SafeDisc DRM."
