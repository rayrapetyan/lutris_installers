name: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
year: 1989
user: RobLoach
runner: scummvm

version: ScummVM - Archive
description: You can get the game data at https://gamesnostalgia.com/en/download/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade-the-graphic-adventure/3121
notes: The archive at gamesnostalgia.com already contains the ScummVM runner (which
  we will not use). The game data will end up at $GAMEDIR/indy3. In order for the
  installed game to launch properly, move all the files from $GAMEDIR/indy3 to $GAMEDIR/
  (you can delete the rest). Or you can go to the runner settings and point it to
  $GAMEDIR/indy3 instead.
