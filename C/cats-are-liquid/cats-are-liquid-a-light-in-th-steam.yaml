notes: 'When I ran the game first time - there was a bug - 1x1 resolution, so, if
  you will have this issue, you should go to ~/.config/unity3d/LastQuarter Studios/Cats
  are Liquid and open the "prefs" file in the text editor. Then you change the NUM
  in this line, to change screen height: "<pref name="Screenmanager Resolution Height"
  type="int">NUM</pref>", and NUM here, to change width: "<pref name="Screenmanager
  Resolution Width" type="int">NUM</pref>" (or you can change NUM here to 1, to use
  your native resolution: "<pref name="Screenmanager Resolution Use Native" type="int">NUM</pref>")'
