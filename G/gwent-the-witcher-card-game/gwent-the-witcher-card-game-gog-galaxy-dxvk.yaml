notes: "You'll have to install Gwent manually through GOG Galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe game\
  \ might not accept any mouse/keyboard input after you pressed ALT+TAB.\r\n\r\nIf\
  \ the game launches but you get black screen after loading then rename the file\
  \ `drive_c/Program Files (x86)/GOG Galaxy/Games/Gwent/Gwent_Data/StreamingAssets/videos/gwent/tut001_narrator_intro`\
  \ to `tut001_narrator_intro2` (or just delete the file). This should only be required\
  \ if you haven't done the ingame tutorial yet."
