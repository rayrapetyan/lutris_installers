description: You can use the latest Wine release (currently TKG's Protonified 4.6
  release) to play this, I suspect nothing will bring change to this. For some reason
  though (no matter what I try) the performance is garbage (can easily pump 100+FPS
  on max on Windows, but it struggles on WineSteam).
notes: "Manual edit required: \"config.cfg\" in the game's `players` folder if a blur\
  \ effect envelopes the screen on ADS. Look the line: `seta r_dof_enable`. Set the\
  \ value to `\"0\"`.\r\n\r\nOnce in-game you might run into texture and model issues\
  \ if you enable AA (Antialiasing). Keep it off if you experience this issue."
