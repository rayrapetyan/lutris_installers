description: Voxel Turf is a block based city builder/action adventure game. Build
  cities or destroy them. Start businesses or rob them. Nurture your citizens or subjugate
  them. Build a real estate empire, or perhaps just drive around and blow stuff up.
  Its your choice! Voxel Turf allows you to be the force of benevolence or the agent
  of chaos in a city of your creation.
