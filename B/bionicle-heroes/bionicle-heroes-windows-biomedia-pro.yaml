notes: "ISSUES:\r\n*Emulated Desktop causes poor performance and the game cannot load.\r\
  \n     -Emulated Desktop also will cause the cursor to disappear until the game\
  \ is exited-out of if alt-tabbing away\r\n\r\n- - - -\r\n\r\nWIDESCREEN:\r\nFirstly,\
  \ actually load up the game, go into the video settings and set the graphics quality\
  \ to what you desire, make sure Widescreen is set on, if given the option, and save\
  \ your changes, to generate config file in Application Data.\r\n\r\nThen, cd to\
  \ \"/... /drive_c/users/<username>/Local Settings/Application Data/EIDOS/BIONICLE\
  \ Heroes\"\r\n\r\nEdit nuconfig.txt, at the bottom section, you'll see NU_PCRESW,\
  \ NU_PCRESH, and NU_PCWIDESCREEN. These stand for PC Resolution Width and height,\
  \ respectively, and the final sets the game to widescreen mode.\r\n\r\nTo use Widescreen,\
  \ set NU_PCWIDESCREEN to high (1), and then change the width and height to whatever\
  \ you like--1920x1080 works perfectly."
