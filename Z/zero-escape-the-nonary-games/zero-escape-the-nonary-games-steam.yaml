description: The launcher fails to start, so this script overwrites Launcher.exe with
  either ze1.exe or ze2.exe. To switch between ZE1 and ZE2, reinstall (no need to
  remove data).
notes: Install the latest LAVFilters from https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases
  (Run EXE inside wine prefix) to fix black screen video hang.
