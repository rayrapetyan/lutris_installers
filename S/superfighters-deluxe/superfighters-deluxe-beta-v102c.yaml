notes: "The game is launched directly without launcher becuase Lutris closes it automatically\
  \ after launching, so that's the temporary solution for now.\r\n\r\nIf you can't\
  \ connect to any game, try:\r\nsudo setcap cap_net_raw+epi /usr/bin/wine-preloader\r\
  \nsudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace+ep /usr/bin/wineserver\r\n\r\nDoesn't work:\r\n- Music\
  \ in main menu\r\n- Buttons in launcher are black with no text (Down right corner\
  \ button launches game)"
