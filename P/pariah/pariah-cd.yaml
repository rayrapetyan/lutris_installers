description: Should install game but seems to not accept disc 2 when installing.  If
  I just insert the disc and double the click the installer (running using my default
  wine prefix) game installs perfectly.  If someone knows how to fix this installer
  please do so.
notes: 'Once game is installed I needed to use the virtual desktop to make the game
  display properly in Cinnamon on Mint. I also edited the files as seen at: https://www.play-old-pc-games.com/2016/01/08/pariah/  under
  the widescreen section.'
