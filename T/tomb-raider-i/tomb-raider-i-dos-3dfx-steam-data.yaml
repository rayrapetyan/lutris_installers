description: Steam game using a patched version of DOSBox with Glide support. Includes
  music and controller support (configured for the XBox 360 controller)
notes: "The game is configured for a 1080p display, you can change this in OpenGLid.ini\
  \ with the Resolution key. \r\nNote that the game will only support 4/3 ratios so\
  \ the value for 1080p is 1440 and not 1920\r\n\r\nWalk is mapped to L3 and look\
  \ is mapped to R3 since L2 and R2 are triggers and won't be properly supported unless\
  \ using xboxdrv."
