description: "Simple installer\r\nenables csmt with registry key\r\ndisables runtime"
notes: "- Uses wine-staging 3.7 \r\n- CSMT has to be enabled. If flickering occurs\
  \ enable it under wine configuration -> wine-staging\r\n- runtime is disabled because\
  \ the game has some problems with resolution and some graphics like mouse pointer\r\
  \n- tested with Logitech F310 Gamepad. Works perfect if the gamepad is set to DirectInput\
  \ with the switch on the back."
