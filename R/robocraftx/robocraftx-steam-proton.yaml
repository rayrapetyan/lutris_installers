notes: "Make sure to enable Steam Play for all titles in Steam settings.\r\nThe game\
  \ may not exit properly if exiting from the menu, so run the game in windowed mode\
  \ and close the window to quit.\r\n\r\nIf the game is on an NTFS partition, make\
  \ sure it's owned by you, otherwise Steam won't be able to launch it.\r\n\r\nIf\
  \ not, add <tt>uid=1000,gid=1000</tt> in mount options for the partition (with your\
  \ IDs, check with id -u <name> and id -g <name>)."
