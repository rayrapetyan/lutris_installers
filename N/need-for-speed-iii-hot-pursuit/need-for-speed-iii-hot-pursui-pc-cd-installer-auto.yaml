name: 'Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit'
year: 1998
user: dsmanneke
runner: wine
slug: need-for-speed-iii-hot-pursui-pc-cd-installer-auto
version: PC CD Installer automenu.exe
description: for cd's that have automenu.exe instead of a autorun.exe
notes: "After setup, first game launch is a black screen. Close the game and wine\
  \ and rerun the game. \r\n\r\nthis is a forced version from the original PC CD Installer:\r\
  \n\r\nI couldn't make the game itself run (only the launcher), but I thought maybe\
  \ this works for others as it has good ratings on winehq\r\n\r\non the winehq page\
  \ there is an additional dll patch for higher resolutions https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=1903&iTestingId=75112\r\
  \n\r\nYou will have to mount the CD as loop device on some folder or keep the CD\
  \ in while playing the game due to DRM"
