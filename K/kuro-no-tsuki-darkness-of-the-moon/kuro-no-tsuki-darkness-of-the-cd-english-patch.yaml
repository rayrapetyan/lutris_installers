notes: "Workarounds for Japanese characters in files and folders:\r\n- Before installing,\
  \ copy the installer (250 MB exe) from the CD and rename it something with a .zip\
  \ extension.\r\n- When installing the patch, change the install location to C:\\\
  kuro-no-tsuki\r\n- After the installer is finished, rename the game exe something\
  \ without Japanese characters. In the Lutris client, right click the game -> configure\
  \ -> game options -> select the renamed executable.\r\n- If the game isn't centered\
  \ in the virtual desktop the first time you launch it, quit and relaunch."
