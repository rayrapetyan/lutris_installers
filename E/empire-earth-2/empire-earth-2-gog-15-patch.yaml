version: GOG + 1.5 patch
description: "This is the installer for the GOG Version + the unofficial 1.5 patch\
  \ from ee2.eu (needed for multiplayer and more in-game functionality).\r\nThis script\
  \ downloads the newest patch version automatically."
notes: "You need to install Wine dependencies first, like for the blizzard app: <a\
  \ href=\"https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Game:-Blizzard-App#dependencies-for-blizzard-app\"\
  >https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Game:-Blizzard-App#dependencies-for-blizzard-app</a>\r\
  \nYou also need to install MS fonts like explained here: <a href=\"https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Game:-Blizzard-App#system-dependencies-for-fixing-font-rendering-errors\"\
  >https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Game:-Blizzard-App#system-dependencies-for-fixing-font-rendering-errors</a>\r\
  \n\r\nSelect YES when you get the Unsupported Operating System message during installation\
  \ of the patch.\r\n\r\nWhen you start the game the first time you get a message\
  \ telling you to not use the compatibility mode, just click yes.\r\n\r\nIf you have\
  \ missing textures try to disable DX9 in the UP1.5 Settings. \r\n\r\nSometimes the\
  \ keys aren't working in the game. Just tab out and tab back in."
