notes: "Don't turn on the \"Bloom\" setting as it will result in a black screen for\
  \ some graphic cards/driver.\r\nChanging the resolution may crash the game or display\
  \ a grey screen.\r\nIf game rendering seems to get stuck on the first frame, set\
  \ the 'fidelity' setting to medium or lower."
