description: "This mod was tested and it runs with the DVD version of GTA San Andreas\
  \ 1.0. Using it with the steam version may work if you downgrade your game version\
  \ to GTA San Andreas 1.0 manually.\r\n\r\nThis installer includes the SA-MP Addon\
  \ 2.3 which enables 1080p resolution and many other features and improvements"
notes: "Installation instructions:\r\n- when the installer for the SA-MP Addon pops\
  \ up, browse to the directory where you have installed GTA San Andreas and the patch\
  \ will be installed with no problems (it does not detect properly the game directory)\r\
  \n\r\nTip:\r\n- if you are using wine staging after you have installed SA-MP and\
  \ SA-MP Addon it is recommended to right click the San Andreas Multiplayer entry\
  \ in Lutris, then Wine configuration -> Staging and \"Enable VAAPI as backend for\
  \ DXVA2 GPU decoding\" for better performance\r\n\r\nKnown bugs:\r\n- if you try\
  \ to run GTA San Andreas from this installation the mod will break and to fix it\
  \ you must delete \"gta_sa.set\" from drive_c/users/\"your_user\"/My Documents/GTA\
  \ San Andreas User Files/\r\n\r\n- SA-MP Addon does not detect properly the game\
  \ installation and you will have to poit it manually to the apropriate directory\
  \ when the addon is installed\r\n\r\nMore information about SA-MP Addon 2.3 and\
  \ on how to downgrade GTA San Andreas to version 1.0.0 can be found on the web.\r\
  \n\r\nEnjoy!"
