version: Wine Steam with Faudio
description: Windows Steam Version with DXVK and FAudio installed. Occasional stutter,
  but perfectly playable.
notes: "FAudio (https://github.com/Kron4ek/FAudio-Builds) installed - to address audio\
  \ / script sync. problems.\r\n - Skyrim first-time setup will overwrite faudio files\r\
  \n\r\nALSA - to get better sound (May differ for another system - try pulseaudio\
  \ instead)\r\n\r\nBy sound issues try to change phonon VLC backend to Gstreamer\
  \ backend."
