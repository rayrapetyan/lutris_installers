description: "I just copied this from the Minecraft game page.\r\n\r\nOriginal description:\r\
  \n\r\nYou will have to update the launcher manually. The game itself can be updated\
  \ from the launcher .\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: YOU NEED A COPY OF THE GAME BOUGHT ON GOOGLE\
  \ PLAY FOR IT TO WORK and you have to log into the launcher using your google account.\
  \ If you don't own the game you will only have access to the trial mode.\r\n\r\n\
  For now you have to set up the game version manually editing your profile if the\
  \ launcher is stuck at \"Please wait\""
