description: "When asked to run the Patch Switcher do so and choose the patch you\
  \ want to install. Version 1.09 is recommend but can be changed at any time.\r\n\
  \r\nThe game features a limited amount of in-game resolution options. The default\
  \ will be 1080p. To use e.g. 1440p you'll have to edit the Options.ini manually\
  \ or re-run the Patch Switcher and click the \"Fix my resolution\" button."
