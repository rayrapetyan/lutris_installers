description: This is an installer for the GOG version of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. COP written
  with the intent of being as vanilla as possible. It is currently configured to run
  on dx9 (the only available API atm) with optional access to Enhanced Full Dynamic
  Lighting.
notes: "- The GOG installer will not pop-up. This is intentional (be patient, it takes\
  \ a minute).\r\n- You will need to set COP's resolution manually. It will ruin your\
  \ desktop resolution most likely on first run.\r\n- You will have to disable the\
  \ built in d3dx10/d3dx11 libs manually as per the instructions on WineDB. I have\
  \ them set to install automatically, but cannot set their override to 'disabled'\
  \ the same way. It will still work without them disabled, but if you don't the options\
  \ will list APIs that will make the game unbootable (at least in mods).\r\n- I cannon\
  \ determine how to set the Virtual Desktop setting in lutris using the installer\
  \ script. You will have to set this to your liking."
