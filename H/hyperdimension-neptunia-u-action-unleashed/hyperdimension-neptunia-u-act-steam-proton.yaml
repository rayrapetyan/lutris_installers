description: Game works correctly, but runs slower than on Windows.
notes: "When launched, the game sometimes stays on a black screen for a while. Clicking\
  \ repeatedly (or pressing the A or X button on a controller) for a couple of seconds\
  \ seems to get the game going and shows the splash screens as expected.\r\n\r\n\
  Aside from this, the game runs perfectly, albeit with occasional slight performance\
  \ drops when many enemies are on-screen. When tested under Windows, these performance\
  \ drops did not occur, so it is assumed they are a symptom of running through Proton."
