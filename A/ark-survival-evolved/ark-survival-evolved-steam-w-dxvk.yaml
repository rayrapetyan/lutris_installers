description: ARK does have a native Linux version but that one looks ugly. This installer
  allows you to play ARK in a more beautiful version.
notes: "- After a few hours or maybe minutes, depending on your system and the map\
  \ you're playing, the game could fall into an stop n' go mode. Just restart ARK\
  \ and you'll be good.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes changing graphic settings to low and back\
  \ to your configuration solves the problem sometimes as well."
