description: The installer will raise the default FPS limit of 20 to 60 FPS and increase
  the maximum allowed zoom level and camera angles for convenience. The increased
  framerate will speed up some animations but shouldn't affect gameplay.
notes: "- The game crashes with aspect ratios wider than 16:10 when opening the research\
  \ menu (F2 key). Select a 16:10 or more narrow resolution to work around this issue.\r\
  \n- Playing back the intro movie doesn't work, please disable it in the setup tool.\r\
  \n- To change the FPS limit of 60 FPS edit the value of \"graphrate\" in the file\
  \ $GAMEDIR/drive_c/GOG Games/Earth 2150/autoexec.con\r\n- To play the game without\
  \ the modifications to framerate and camera delete $GAMEDIR/drive_c/GOG Games/Earth\
  \ 2150/autoexec.con"
