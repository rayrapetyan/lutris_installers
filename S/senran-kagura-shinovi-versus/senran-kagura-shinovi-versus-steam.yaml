description: "Simple installer\r\nenables csmt with registry key\r\ndisables runtime"
notes: "- Uses wine-staging 3.7 (prior 2.21; 3.0 - 3.5 had problems with sound or\
  \ even starting)\r\n- CSMT has to be enabled. If flickering occurs enable it under\
  \ wine configuration -> wine-staging\r\n- runtime is disabled because the game has\
  \ some problems with resolution and some graphics like mouse pointer\r\n- tested\
  \ with Logitech F310 Gamepad. It was necessary to use the antimicro keymapper to\
  \ let it properly work."
