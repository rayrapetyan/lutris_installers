notes: "- Recent GOG installer required (v2 or above).\r\n- Uses the Commandos 2+3\
  \ GOG installer but only installs Commandos 3.\r\n- Fix for multiplayer by TCP/IP\
  \ included.\r\n- The mouse may not be captured well initially, just move it around\
  \ until the cursor appears and avoid clicking until then. Use the Escape key to\
  \ skip the intro movies."
