notes: "This installer will try to install AdobeAir from the binaries. It seems that\
  \ the keyring is better supported from Lutris and at least it will try to install\
  \ it.\r\n\r\nIf Adobe AIR crash, try to install it on your own. That\u2019s how\
  \ I fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nHere is the repo I used for Debian 9++:\r\nhttp://update.devolo.com/linux/apt/"
