version: PC CD Installer
description: This installer is based on a "Green Pepper"-Published CD I had lying
  around, which is why some other CDs could call it setup.exe instead of AUTORUN.EXE
notes: "I couldn't make the game itself run (only the launcher), but I thought maybe\
  \ this works for others as it has good ratings on winehq\r\n\r\non the winehq page\
  \ there is an additional dll patch for higher resolutions https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=1903&iTestingId=75112\r\
  \n\r\nYou will have to mount the CD as loop device on some folder or keep the CD\
  \ in while playing the game due to DRM"
