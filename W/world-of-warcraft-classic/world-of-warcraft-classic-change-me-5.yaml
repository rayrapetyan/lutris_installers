notes: "**IMPORTANT: INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES FIRST**\r\nRead: Game: World-of-Warcraft\
  \ before trying to install World of Warcraft. And install the needed dependencies\
  \ for Wine into your system. Also, make sure you have Vulkan set up correctly.\r\
  \nSame steps as with WoW retail, if you've already installed retail successfully\
  \ you can just download Classic within your Battle.net launcher."
