description: "Simple installer\r\nenables csmt with registry key\r\ndisables runtime"
notes: "- Uses wine-staging 3.7 (prior 2.21; 3.0 - 3.5 had problems with sound or\
  \ even starting)\r\n- Needs 64bit Wineprefix\r\n- CSMT has to be enabled. If flickering\
  \ occurs enable it under wine configuration -> wine-staging\r\n- runtime is disabled\
  \ because the game has some problems with resolution and some graphics like mouse\
  \ pointer\r\n- tested with Logitech F310 Gamepad. Works perfectly if set to DirectInput\
  \ (the switch on the back is set to D)"
