notes: "-You will need to paste the the following launch commands for Watch Dogs 2,\
  \ which can be found at Game > Properties > Game launch arguments > Add command\
  \ line arguments: <b>-eac_launcher -nosplash</b>\r\n-<b>The installer provides a\
  \ pre-generated DXVK state cache to provide a mostly stutter-free experience. As\
  \ a result, it will cause a temporary performance hit while the shaders are being\
  \ compiled. The FPS will rise back up after it has finished.</b>\r\n-The Uplay overlay\
  \ is automatically disabled, and will cause problems if enabled. Do not enable it.\r\
  \n-Easy Anti Cheat does not work and as a result any multiplayer functionality will\
  \ not work, it is also disabled using the launch commands from above.\r\n-If alt-tabbing,\
  \ the game will sometimes rapidly try to regain focus and then lose focus. As if\
  \ its spazzing out."
