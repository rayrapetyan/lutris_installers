notes: "The file path to the exe includes what looks like randomly generated folders\
  \ and because of that Lutris can't set the exe for you. To do this manually you\
  \ must open the Lutris Config window, select the Game options tab, click browse\
  \ next to the executable field, and navigate to the exe located at:\r\n\r\n<tt>$HOME/Games/magic-the-gathering-online/drive_c/users/$USER/AppData/Local/Apps/2.0/Randomletters/Randomletters/mtgo...tionRandomletters/MGTO.exe</tt>"
