notes: "Manual tasks:\r\n- You must manually proceed through the installation.\r\n\
  \r\n- You will be required to set the resolution near the end of the script, as\
  \ it was not possible to get a hexadecimal representation of screen resolution values\
  \ using the script.\r\n\r\n- When first starting the game, you may need to set key\
  \ bindings (Options > Customize Controls > Redefine Controls).\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\
  \n- Game music does not play, even with disc mounted or inserted.\r\n- Alt-tabbing\
  \ will cause the application to go black."
