description: A (buggy) manual installation, avoiding the need to use the non-runnable
  FreeSO launcher. Expect to relog often, with the occasional crash.

  \n\r\nCurrently uses a pomf.cat mirror of http://servo.freeso.org/repository/download/FreeSO_TsoClient/673:id/client-515.zip,\
  \ as that link requires a browser to be downloaded. This is not a permanent solution\
  \ and should be fixed later. The version downloaded should not matter as it is updated\
  \ when run anyway."
