version: CD (GOTY)
description: Installs from the original Sierra branded CD-ROM without the need for
  the Steam client.  To my knowledge, this is the only way to run Half-Life on Linux
  legally without the Steam client.
notes: "When it prompts \"Did you hear the sound file?\" say yes, even if you didn't\
  \ hear anything.\r\nClick the default options in the installer.\r\nDon't opt to\
  \ update the game during installation.\r\nDon't opt to register or to run the game\
  \ through the windows installer at the end.\r\nOn first run, the game will ask for\
  \ a CD Key.  You can either use your legitimate key or find one online.\r\nThe game\
  \ won't play its CD audio OST without the disc inserted, but the game is quite playable\
  \ after install without a disc."
