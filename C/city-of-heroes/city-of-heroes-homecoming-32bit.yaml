notes: "When run for the first  time it will ask for an install directory.  You can\
  \ use what is selected by default.\r\n\r\nThe Tequila client may have issues downloading\
  \ some of the other software it can run like paragon chat.  This will prevent the\
  \ play button from appearing.  You can by pass that by just double clicking on Homecoming\
  \ in the navbar to load the game.\r\n\r\nAfter loading the game you might need to\
  \ hit \"Alt-Enter\" to change to windowed mode as the resolution may not be supported."
