notes: "Installable and Playable but not in native Display Resolution and with Border,\
  \ need to work on that.\r\nGame doesn't start because of XRandr error, not finding\
  \ profile for resolution 800x600.\r\nEnable Wine virtual desktop through right-click\
  \ -> Wine configuration -> Graphics -> Enable virtual desktop.\r\nDon't know if\
  \ bug of Lutris or Wine 4.0, but you maybe have to disable and renable the Virtual\
  \ desktop after first start and crash of the game."
