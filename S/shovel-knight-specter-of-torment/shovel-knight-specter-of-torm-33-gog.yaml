description: "Installer for the current version of \"Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment\"\
  \ available in GOG.\r\n\r\nLibraries included in LD_LIBRARY_PATH needed by the lutris\
  \ runtime seem to conflict with those of the game (at least in my setup, Ubuntu\
  \ 17.10), so that the lutris runtime needs to be disabled for the game to work properly\
  \ (otherwise a black screen is displayed to the user after running the game)."
notes: 'Requires version 3.3 of GOG''s Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment Linux installer.'
