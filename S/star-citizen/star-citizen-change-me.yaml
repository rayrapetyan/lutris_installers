description: "Welcome to the Star Citizen installer maintained by the Star Citizen\
  \ LUG!\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to read through the technical instructions in the\
  \ installer, which are important to prevent game crashes.\r\n\r\nFor help with the\
  \ installer or just hang out we invite Linux Star Citizen players to join us: https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/LUG/"
notes: "Please make sure you have all Wine dependencies properly installed, else your\
  \ game may crash during start-up. A good starting point is this post from GloriousEggroll:\
  \ https://www.gloriouseggroll.tv/how-to-get-out-of-wine-dependency-hell/\r\n\r\n\
  Furthermore, to prevent crashes at areas with lots of geometry, the game needs a\
  \ Linux resource limit named \"vm.max_map_count\" increased. To do this, execute:\r\
  \n\r\nsudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=16777216\r\n\r\n(Consult your distro's documentation\
  \ on how to set this permanently, or ask a LUG member)"
