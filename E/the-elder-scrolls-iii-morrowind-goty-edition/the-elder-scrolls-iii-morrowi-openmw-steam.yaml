name: 'The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind GOTY Edition'
year: 2003
user: strider
runner: linux
slug: the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowi-openmw-steam
version: OpenMW + Steam
description: OpenMW 0.45.0 64 bit engine and game data from Steam + official plug-ins
  from bethsoft.com
notes: Upon first run, the Morrowind.ini file needs to be converted to openmw through
  the automated installer.  The modules for the main game also need to be placed in
  the proper order within the launcher; the steam installation seems to have them
  out of order by default.
