description: "This mod was tested and it runs with the DVD version of GTA San Andreas\
  \ 1.0. Using it with the steam version may work if you downgrade your game version\
  \ to GTA San Andreas 1.0 and you install it in the apropriate game directory. (info\
  \ online)\r\n\r\nThis installer includes the SA-MP Addon 2.3 wich enables 1080p\
  \ resolution and many other features and improvements\r\nThis mod works best with\
  \ Wine Staging, because Non Staging versions of Wine will not render other players\
  \ health and names"
notes: "NOTE: When you are prompted to choose the instalation directory, choose the\
  \ folder where you have already installed GTA San Andreas \r\nAlso if you try to\
  \ play San Andreas and this mod from the same installation it will break the mod,\
  \ a separate GTA San Adreas installation is advised just for playing the mod\r\n\
  BEFORE installation go into your GTA San Andreas directory and make sure that the\
  \ gta_sa.exe permissions are set to \"Read and Write\" for the Owner\r\n\r\nInstallation\
  \ instructions:\r\n- the first SA-MP installer needs to be pointed at the folder\
  \ where you have GTA San Andreas already installed and it will detect  the apropriate\
  \ game directory and will install as intended\r\n- when the second installer for\
  \ the SA-MP Addon pops up, browse to the directory where you have installed GTA\
  \ San Andreas and the patch will be installed with no problems (it does not detect\
  \ properly the game directory)\r\n- after you have installed SA-MP and SA-MP Addon\
  \ it is recommended to right click the San Andreas Multiplayer entry in Lutris,\
  \ then Wine configuration -> Staging and \"Enable VAAPI as backend for DXVA2 GPU\
  \ decoding\" for better performance\r\n\r\nKnown bugs:\r\n- if you already played\
  \ GTA SA before installing this mod SA-MP will crash if you try to change the resolution\
  \ of the game. You can workaround this by installing SA-MP in a fresh installed\
  \ GTA San Andreas.\r\n- SA-MP Addon does not detect properly the game installation\
  \ and you will have to poit it manually to the apropriate directory when the addon\
  \ is installed\r\n- Using SA-MP with Non Staging versions of Wine will not show\
  \ you the health bars and names of the other players\r\n\r\nMore informations about\
  \ SA-MP Addon 2.3 and on how to downgrade GTA San Andreas to version 1.0.0 can be\
  \ found on the web.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
