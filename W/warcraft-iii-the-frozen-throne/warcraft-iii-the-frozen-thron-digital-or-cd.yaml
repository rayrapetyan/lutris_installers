  III: The Frozen Throne. A retail CD version of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne should
  also work.'
notes: "- An installed version of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos is required to install\
  \ this expansion set.\r\n- Ingame videos are disabled (by adding a \"TFT\" suffix\
  \ to the /Movies/ folder name) to avoid a possible crash. You can try to revert\
  \ this and see if the movies play on your system.\r\n- Although the installer fails\
  \ on asking for the cd-keys on first launch of the game it will ask for the cd-keys\
  \ without failure. If the cd-key window is blank just moved it out of screen bounds\
  \ and move it back in. Some rendering issues."
