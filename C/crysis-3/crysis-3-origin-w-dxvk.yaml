description: Only sets up Origin and DXVK you'll need to download Crysis 3 manually.
notes: "Please read before installing: <a href=\"https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Game:-Origin\"\
  >https://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Game:-Origin</a>\r\n\r\n1. Inside the game\
  \ menus, go to settings and select \"full screen\" (also change any other option\
  \ you might want).\r\n\r\n2. Try to play the game. If the mouse movement is not\
  \ restricted (ie. you can rotate the view 360 deg) you are good to go (skip the\
  \ rest of steps). Otherwise keep reading.\r\n\r\n3. Exit the game and Lutris.\r\n\
  \r\n4. In the Lutris menus, right click on \"Crysis 3\" and select \"Configure -->\
  \ Runner options --> Mouse Warp Override = Force\"\r\n\r\n5. Run the game. This\
  \ time you will need to use the KEYBOARD to navigate the menus, but once inside\
  \ the game, everything will work as expected (this is a wine issue, explained here\
  \ in case you are curious: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43918 )\r\n\r\
  \n---\r\nYou may encounter some stuttering when first running game but after a few\
  \ minutes the DXVK cache builds and the stuttering disappears."
