notes: "You will have to update the launcher manually. The game itself can be updated\
  \ from the launcher .\r\n\r\n<b>Disclaimer:</b> YOU NEED A COPY OF THE GAME BOUGHT\
  \ ON GOOGLE PLAY FOR IT TO WORK and you have to log into the launcher using your\
  \ google account. If you don't own the game you will only have access to the trial\
  \ mode.\r\n\r\nFor now you have to set up the game version manually editing your\
  \ profile if the launcher is stuck at \"Please wait\"\r\n\r\nDiscord: <a href=\"\
