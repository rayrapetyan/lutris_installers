description: This installer is Esync and DXVK ready.
notes: "1) After installation, do not hit 'Play' immediately. Close the installer,\
  \ then launch the game from lutris.\r\n\r\n2) If you get DirectX errors, it means\
  \ you're missing 32 bit vulkan libraries and/or 32 bit graphic drivers. You need\
  \ both 32 bit and 64 bit vulkan libraries installed on your system. The reason is\
  \ because the game is 64 bit but the launcher is 32 bit so the launcher checks for\
  \ 32 bit. See:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/lutris/lutris/wiki/Installing-drivers\r\
  \n\r\n3) To save on disk space, you may wish to remove the 'Installer' folder after\
  \ installation is finished. By default this should be located at /home/username/Games/warframe/Installer\r\
  \n\r\nFor issues, feel free to join my (GloriousEggroll)'s discord. We h ave many\
  \ users using a variety of methods to play the game including my launcher and a\
  \ custom proton version for steam:\r\n\r\nhttps://discord.gg/6y3BdzC\r\n\r\n**************************\r\
  \n\r\nThere is no discord integration in warframe because in order to do so would\
  \ be against the Warframe TOS:\r\n\r\nhttps://forums.warframe.com/topic/1003139-simple-question-regarding-discord-rpcdll-for-devs/"
