description: This game requires an SSD hard drive as 3D models are lazy loaded constantly.
notes: "With AMD graphics (with or without DXVK), it's highly recommended to use a\
  \ virtual desktop as GW2's launcher will slow most desktop environments to a crawl\
  \ only recoverable by hard reboot. Running GW2's exe with -image lets it download\
  \ all game data and updates. For convenience, It's recommended to create a context\
  \ menu entry for updating the game.\r\n\r\nTo improve perfomance, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/fhEr0rW.jpg\"\
  >these settings</a>. are suggested. Also, using a fast SSD hard drive can massively\
  \ reduce, or eliminate stuttering on this game."
