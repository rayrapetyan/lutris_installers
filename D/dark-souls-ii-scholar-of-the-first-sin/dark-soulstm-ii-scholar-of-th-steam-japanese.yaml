notes: "In order to download the version of Dark Souls 2 with Japanese language support,\
  \ one has to purchase the game while on a Japanese IP address. There is actually\
  \ a different page presented for this version for a different steamid, note that\
  \ there is a line on the store page stating that this is the version with Japanese\
  \ support (\u304A\u77E5\u3089\u305B: \u3053\u306E\u30D0\u30FC\u30B8\u30E7\u30F3\u306E\
  \u30B2\u30FC\u30E0\u306F\u65E5\u672C\u8A9E\u3092\u542B\u307F\u307E\u3059\u3002);\
  \ even though there is still no support stated in the usual place for language support.\r\
  \n\r\nThe grass and other types of foliage seem to only appear when you are standing\
  \ in them but everything else renders right."
