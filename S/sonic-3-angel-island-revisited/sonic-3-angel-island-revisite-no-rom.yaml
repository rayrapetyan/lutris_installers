description: Installs Steam, SEGA Mega Drive & Genesis Classics (both prerequisites)
  and Sonic 3 Angel Island Revisited for the No-ROM-File Sonic 3 A.I.R. experience.
notes: "You MUST have bought 'Sonic 3 & Knuckles' (for SEGA Mega Drive & Genesis Classics)\
  \ from the Steam Store and then log into Steam during the installation process with\
  \ that account you purchased the game on for this installer to work.\r\n\r\nYou\
  \ will need to do parts of the process manually, however the steps will be made\
  \ obvious to you once manual input is needed. Steam will also need to be installed\
  \ by the user during the installation process as a prerequisite first."
