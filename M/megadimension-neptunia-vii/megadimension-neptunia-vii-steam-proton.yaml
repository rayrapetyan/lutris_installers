notes: "This game currently does not run with the default Proton prefix. To get it\
  \ working, a Wine32 prefix needs to be installed to replace the default proton prefix.\
  \ This installer places a script in the game directories to automate this process.\r\
  \n\r\nEssentially, to install and run the game, do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Click\
  \ install on the Lutris website and follow the standard install procedure.\r\n\r\
  \n2. Run the game once (If it works as expected, don't bother with the following\
  \ steps)\r\n\r\n3. If the game black-screens or doesn't work, open the game files\
  \ directory and run the script called \"nep-vii-setup.sh\". in a terminal.\r\n\r\
  \n4. The script may require sudo/root privileges to remove the old prefix, (it will\
  \ attempt to remove it without root first) depending on how Steam is setup. If this\
  \ is necessary, type the password as expected.\r\n\r\n5. Work through the various\
  \ installers that show up, exiting Windows Media Player when it appears.\r\n\r\n\
  6. Launch the game again.\r\nOccasionally, the game may still not work fully after\
  \ this process. Restarting the computer will generally fix this."
