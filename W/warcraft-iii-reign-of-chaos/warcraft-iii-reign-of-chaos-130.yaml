notes: "When Prompted by the installer, please set the install directory to 'Program\
  \ Files', NOT 'Program Files (x86)'\r\nAlthough the installer fails on asking for\
  \ the cd-keys on first launch of the game it will ask for the cd-keys without failure.\
  \ If the cd-key window is blank just moved it out of screen bounds and move it back\
  \ in. Some rendering issues."
