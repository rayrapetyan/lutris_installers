notes: "-Proper setup of NVIDIA driver is highly recommended or FullScreen mode will\
  \ not work! (if you can't change it in the game you can change it under Settings\
  \ > Local Files > Browse local files, then go under savedata and one folder below\
  \ you will find a file named config.dat. Then change screen_type=1 to screen_type=0.)\r\
  \n\r\n-I didn't encounter any issues so far, but disabling esync may be necessary.\
  \ (It was necessary for SK Burst re:Newal which uses the same engine)"
