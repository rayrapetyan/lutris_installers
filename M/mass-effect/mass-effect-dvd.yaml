description: "During installation, the default installation folder may be different\
  \ depending on the ISO file used, be careful to select the right folder.\r\n\r\n\
  Screen resolution MUST BE configured in the launcher ( some resolutions are missing\
  \ the game's options )"
notes: Prefer to launch the game with "MassEffectLauncher.exe" than "/Binaries/MassEffect.exe"
  for avoid some screen glitch and missings resolutions for the game
