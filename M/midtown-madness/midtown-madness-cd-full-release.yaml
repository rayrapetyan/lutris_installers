version: CD Full Release
description: Installs the game and the necessary patches to launch and run the game
  relatively smoothly on Linux.  The game is run using Xephyr to satisfy the 16-bit
  color requirement.
notes: "When the Midtown Madness 2 installer has finished, do not click \"Play Now\"\
  , as the game will not launch.  Close the window and allow the Lutris installer\
  \ to continue.\r\n\r\nNote: After installation, the game will launch without the\
  \ CD, but the CD needs to be inserted for the music to work.  If there is still\
  \ no music, make sure MIDTOWN (the data portion of the CD) is mounted in the file\
  \ manager.\r\n\r\nFun fact:  As the music uses CD audio, you can stick the Midtown\
  \ Madness CD in your CD player and listen to the game's soundtrack!"
