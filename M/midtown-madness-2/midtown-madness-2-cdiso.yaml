description: "Installs Midtown Madness 2 and uses dgvoodoo Graphics Api Wrapper by\
  \ Dege, (c) 2013-2019\r\nOfficial website <a href=\"http://dege.fw.hu/\">http://dege.fw.hu/</a>"
notes: "dgVoodoo2 is DirectX 11 wrapper for older graphics APIs, so naturally,  you\
  \ need to have a system that is capable of running DXVK.\r\n\r\nThe executable is\
  \ case sensitive. If your No-CD exe file begins with a lowercase m (midtown2.exe),\
  \ then please rename it to have a capital M (Midtown2.exe), or the installer will\
  \ fail at the final step.\r\n\r\nWhen installing Midtown Madness 2, do not set up\
  \ a custom install path. Using anything other than the default path will not work.\r\
  \n\r\nWhen the Midtown Madness 2 installer has finished, do not click \"Play Now\"\
  . The game will work, but will perform poorly and Lutris will think the game is\
  \ still installing. Close the window and allow the Lutris installer to continue.\r\
  \n\r\nOnce the Lutris installer is finished, you are advised to manually configure\
  \ dgVoodoo2 to use your desired video settings. To do this, right click on Midtown\
  \ Madness 2 in your Lutris library, and click on \"Run EXE inside wine prefix\"\
  . Navigate to \"drive_c/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Midtown Madness 2/\" within\
  \ the prefix and open \"dgVoodooCtl.exe\".\r\n\r\nIf you configure dgVoodoo2 to\
  \ force the resolution, then you must choose a resolution with the same aspect ratio\
  \ in the video settings within Midtown Madness 2, or the game will appear stretched.\r\
  \n\r\nIf you want to install mods then be aware that while they do work, some custom\
  \ maps can cause extreme stuttering in certain areas and may lead to GPU hangs in\
  \ rare cases. I am investigating the cause of this."
