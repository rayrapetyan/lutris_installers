description: "This script will install \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" DVD edition.\r\
  \nDuring install please let all options by default.\r\nBig thanks to people who\
  \ gave their time to permit us playing this game in the best conditions."
notes: "- Supports natively x360 controller\r\n- Known issue: the setup program is\
  \ a little unstable, there will be no picture during install and it will crash at\
  \ the end. Happily, the game will be fully installed before the crash. (cf. Wine\
  \ bug https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35319)\r\n- You will need the game\
  \ DVD only one time during install\r\n- Please report issue concerning this script\
  \ on my github page:\r\nhttps://github.com/legluondunet/MyLittleLutrisScripts/"
