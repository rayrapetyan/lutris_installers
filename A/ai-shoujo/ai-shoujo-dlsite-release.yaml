description: Installs AI Shoujo on Linux using WINE, as well as winhttp as a override.
notes: At this time there is a bug relating to controlling the camera after alt-tabbing
  out. To fix this, move your mouse cursor, while AI Shoujo is the active program
  - back and forth along any edge of the window until the camera works properly again.
  Beyond this, there are no known bugs.
