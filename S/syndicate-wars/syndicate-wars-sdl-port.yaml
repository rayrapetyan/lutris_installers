description: "Syndicate Wars Port is a port of the 1996 DOS game Syndicate Wars to\
  \ modern operating systems. In particular, it runs on GNU, Mac OS and Windows, but\
  \ it should also work on any system supported by the SDL library on the i386 architecture.\r\
  \n\r\nThe port is not fully complete. It is possible to finish the single player\
  \ campaigns, but support for networking is missing. There is also no support for\
  \ joystick control."
